A Student Management System (SMS) is a software application designed to help educators and institutions manage student data, track academic progress, and organize school activities. It allows teachers to record grades, attendance, and assignments, while students can access their grades, schedules, and course materials. This system helps streamline communication between students, teachers, and administrators, ensuring an organized and efficient educational environment.
